hi, i'm Abdul

I am currently studying informatics at UNISMUH Makassar. I am also studying at [COCONUT](https://Coconut.or.id) as a system engineer.

I like systems learning, human-computer interaction, and System engineering development. I also like my fair share of visual arts and creativity. In my spare time, I eat mangoes and play snorkeling.
